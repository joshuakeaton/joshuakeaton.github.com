1220725520|Sue J |Hello Joshua. I like the effort you put into your videos but I am concerned with the swearing language you use occasionally. Some good Christian folks might take offense, especially for the younger ones. Others would say that it&#039;s not at all &quot;in the key of Jesus&quot;.<br /><br />What is your stance on that issue and will you stop if people ask you to?<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Sue J |99.230.238.240|

Jesus turned water into wine for a reason! Obviously for health, but also for taste and good times. Today we just happen to be able to make some new kinds of alcohol that they didn&#039;t even think about back then (well, He did, but you know how it goes with politics). So vodka? Why the H-E-double hockey stick not?<br /><br />Fun tip: toss a couple pickled green beans into your bloody caesar for an extra kick in the noggin. I guarantee you that Jesus would approve! |99.230.238.240|
